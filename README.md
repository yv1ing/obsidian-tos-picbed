Used to automatically upload pictures to TOS and delete remote files when pictures are deleted

Key Features

1. Paste images and automatically upload them to object storage, eliminating the need to install software like PicGo locally.

2. Delete images and delete the files in object storage simultaneously, preventing unwanted images from being left in the cloud and causing unnecessary overhead.

3. Delete all images in the current document with one click, eliminating the need to manually delete each image individually.
